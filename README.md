<h1 align="center">FilmFlix</h1>

<p>Currently in development, take a look at it here ðŸ‘‰ https://film-flix-opal.vercel.app/</p>

<h2 align="center">Tech Used</h2> 
<p align="center"> React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, React-Icons, Hero-Icons, Next.js, Next-Auth, MongoDB, Prisma, Axios, Toastify, Photoshop</p>

<h2 align="center">Goals and Accomplishments</h2>
I wanted to explore and learn more by using React, Typescript, and Next.js to build a fun movie trailer app that replicated Netflix. 

<p>I am using NextAuth for authentication, and bcrypt so passwords are hashed, and nothing is exposed. This site is for demonstration purposes, please do not use your real Netflix Password.</p>

<h2 align="center">Optimizations</h2>

Optimized this to fit all screen sizes as best as possible. The goal was for the user to have a fluid experience on all their devices. Designed with mobile-first in mind.
