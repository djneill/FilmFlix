<h1 align="center">FilmFlix</h1>

<p>Currently in development, take a look at it here <a href="https://film-flix-opal.vercel.app/auth">https://film-flix-opal.vercel.app/auth</a></p>
<p>It is currently being flagged by Google as "Dangerous". It is not dangerous or phishing, They are flagging it because it closely resembles Netflix's actual site.</p>
<p>I am using NextAuth and bcrypt for authentication so all passwords are hashed and nothing is exposed.</p>
